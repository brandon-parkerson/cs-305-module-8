## Journal Entry
Artemis Financial is a financial services company ocused on offering secure and efficient financial management tools to its customers. The company faced challenges related to software vulnerabilities, including potential security gaps in its financial applications. My task was to conduct a thorough vulnerability assessment and implement secure coding practices to mitigate risks and strengthen the application’s overall security.
### What I did well
I think I did well in finding what the critical points of vulnerabilities in the system were. Secure coding is critical because it helps protect sensitive client data, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures trust in the company’s services. For Artemis Financial, secure software adds significant value by safeguarding customer information and ensuring regulatory compliance.
### What was Challenging
A challenging aspect was analyzing the codebase to identify subtle vulnerabilities like insecure API usage. However, this process also helped me understand the critical importance of proactive security measures and learn effective strategies to assess risks.
### Future Practices
To increase layers of security, I implemented input validation, secure authentication mechanisms, and encryption for sensitive data. In future projects, I would use tools like OWASP ZAP or Nessus for comprehensive vulnerability assessments and rely on frameworks like OWASP Top Ten to prioritize mitigation strategies.
